<h1>Box Shooter First Person Shooter</h1>
<p>It is a simple First Person view shooting game where hitting different targets have different effects like hitting green box would increase your score, hitting a white box to increase time limit by some time and hitting yellow box would decrease the time limit and once the time limit reaches 00 the game will move to game over state.
I just created this game with the whole motive of learning basics for a fps game.
Try to open the html file in firefox as chrome doest support openGL
